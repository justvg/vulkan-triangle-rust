# Project

Simple one file example of rendering a triangle using Vulkan and Rust. The example uses [winit](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit) crate to create and manage window and [ash](https://github.com/MaikKlein/ash) crate for Vulkan.

# Building

First of all you will need Vulkan SDK. Then you can just use Cargo to build and run the project.
